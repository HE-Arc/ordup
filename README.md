# About Ordup

## Context

As part of the Web development course at HE-Arc Ing√©nierie, 3 students are carrying out a project whose goal is to develop a Web application with the Laravel framework. 

## Description

Nowadays, bars are getting bigger and bigger but they don't have more waiters. The menus are getting bigger, the cocktails are getting more complex and all this makes the bartenders' job more and more difficult.

With the constant pressure of work that requires speed and rigor, a lack of organization is quickly apparent. With a web application, bartenders could save time by sending customer requests directly to the bars for cocktail preparation.

## How to use it

This application doesn't allow users to register by themself. Only admin user can register a new user on admin panel. So, here are three credentials that you can use to access to the application:

- david.grunenwald@he-arc.ch - Abc123456
- alxander.wohlhfahrt@he-arc.ch - Abc123456
- luca.laissue@he-arc.ch - Abc123456
